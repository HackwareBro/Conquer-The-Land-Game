# Conquer the Land Game
<b>The main moto to make this game is to polish my problem-solving skills because that's the secret key to achieve success in ethical hacking</b>

I am also working on making CPU mode. At the first, I will make using random selection and after I learned AI then I will surely upgrade it.

I will also improve the readablity of the code after implementing all the features.

<b>This will be updated time to time!</b>

As i said, i just focused on logics so if anyone is interested to improve the UI then his/her contribution will be highly appreciated.
